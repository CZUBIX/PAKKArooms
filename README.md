# Welcome to poligon rooms!

If you want to create your own server, go to https://github.com/CZUBIX/POLIGONrooms and download poligonrooms/server.

Then, do the following:
    1. If you haven't already, install the latest python version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    2. Start server.py and close it right after (just to create the config.ini file)
    3. Start server.py after config.ini is configured properly
    4. Invite friends to your server!
    
You can also write custom plugins, which requires programming knowledge. If you have any problems, contact us. (https://discord.gg/3V3Z5sX)
